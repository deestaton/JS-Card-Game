Write a card game with a shuffle method that uses the hexadecimal numbering system for the cards.

Rather than standard suits(i.e. hearts, clubs, spaces, diamonds), your suits will be: 
Mandela, Dr King, Malcolm X, Madam CJ Walker.

Your game will be the same as high card beats low card, except every 5th deal CJ Walker's cards beat each card.

Your shuffle method will ensure no duplicate hands.

Key methods:

Shuffle()
Deal()
Play()
TakeBook()
